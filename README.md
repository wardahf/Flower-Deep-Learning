# Flower Dataset Classification Using Transfer-Learning-Model
 In this flower model, i am using 5 different types of flowers image dataset i.e daisy, dandelion,sunflower,rose and tulips to design a Transfer Learning to predict 
 the test images.
 Using the MobileNet from keras applications as base model, by making modeifications in convolutional layers and designing Dense Layer architecture, my model accuracy is
 around 90%
